This includes: Python 3.10 or later: Download and install the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ . Virtual Environment: Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies, using python -m venv venv and activate it. Dependency Management: Use pip to install and manage required packages, such as Django, Flask, or FastAPI for web development, and other necessary libraries for data processing and integration with backing services. Owners \u00b6 The owners are responsible for overseeing the development and maintenance of the KYC application. This includes: Project Manager: Responsible for project planning, resource allocation, and communication with stakeholders. Technical Lead: Responsible for making architectural decisions, providing guidance to the development team, and ensuring code quality and performance. Development Team: Responsible for implementing the application components, writing tests, and fixing bugs. Quality Assurance Team: Responsible for testing the application, reporting issues, and validating fixes. Front End \u00b6 The front end is responsible for presenting the user interface and interacting with users. Key components include: UI Framework: Choose a UI framework, such as Bootstrap or Material-UI, to design and implement a responsive and user-friendly interface. Web Application Framework: Use a Python web application framework, such as Django, Flask, or FastAPI, to handle user requests, manage sessions, and serve static files. JavaScript and AJAX: Utilize JavaScript and AJAX for asynchronous requests and to enhance user experience by updating page content without refreshing the page. Form Validation: Implement client-side and server-side validation for user input to ensure data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities. Middleware \u00b6 The middleware layer is responsible for handling the business logic and processing user requests. Key components include: Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT, to manage user access and ensure that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do. API Endpoints: Define RESTful API endpoints to handle user requests and interact with the backing services. Data Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user input data before processing to prevent security vulnerabilities and data corruption. Business Logic: Implement the core KYC processes, including customer identification, risk assessment, due diligence, and ongoing monitoring. Backing Services \u00b6 The backing services are responsible for storing data, handling external integrations, and providing additional functionalities. Key components include: Database: Choose a suitable database, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, to store customer information, transaction data, and audit trails. ORM: Use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, such as SQLAlchemy or Django ORM, to interact with the database and map database tables to Python objects. External Services: Integrate with external services, such as identity verification providers, sanctions list providers, and AML/CTF systems, to enhance the KYC process. Background Jobs and Queues: Implement background jobs and queues, using libraries like Celery or RQ, to handle time-consuming tasks, such as data synchronization, customer screening, and periodic reviews. Contributing to Code Base \u00b6 To ensure a consistent and maintainable code base, follow these guidelines: Version Control: Use a version control system, such as Git, to track code changes, manage branches, and collaborate with team members. Code Review: Implement a code review process to ensure that all changes are reviewed and approved by other team members before merging into the main branch. Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality of the application and prevent regression issues.
